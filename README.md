# üîÑ CI/CD & DevSecOps Pipelines  

This repository brings together **CI/CD automation projects** where I built secure pipelines for multi-cloud environments (AWS & GCP) using Jenkins, CircleCI, Terraform, and Ansible.  

Projects cover **end-to-end delivery workflows**, including:  
- Automated builds and tests  
- Security scans and DevSecOps integration  
- Infrastructure deployments with rollback and cleanup  
- Monitoring with Prometheus
